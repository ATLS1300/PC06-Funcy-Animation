# PC06-Funcy-Animation
Start code &amp; tools to make your own animation using functions

We're starting to move toward task-oriented programming--making code that uses almost entirely functions to execute a task. This will help us build toward Object Oriented Programming (OOP) which is the culmination of this course's education goals. Scary, right? #hallowee!

As you are expending your skillset, you should consider looking to see if the solution you need exists already. Use search engines to search for:
`python turtle` plus whatever the rest of your description is
This means you'll have to practice articulating what you want your code to do!

### Remember to cite code and use no more than 20% of borrowed code
`# code modified from <URL>`
`# code borrowed from <URL>`

There is also a repository of useful code for you to use. The 20% limit does not apply to this code, but you must cite it. Check back frequently, as it will regularly be updated (based on student requests)!

## Requirements
Your assignment must:
1. Have one unique function that is both defined and called. (Please don't borrow a function if you can help it...the point is practice.)
2. At least one function must be called within the animation loop (while loop)
3. (Optional) have a conditional statement that stops the while loop (change the `running` value to `False`)
